# HydroNet Project Structure Guide

## Overview
HydroNet is a comprehensive deep learning framework for solving hydrodynamic problems, featuring three main approaches:
1. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)
2. DeepONet
3. Physics-Informed DeepONet

## Core Components

### Models
The framework includes three main model types:

- [model.py](mdc:HydroNet/models/PINN/model.py): Base PINN model

#### DeepONet Models
Located in [HydroNet/models/DeepONet/](mdc:HydroNet/models/DeepONet):
- [trainer.py](mdc:HydroNet/models/DeepONet/trainer.py): DeepONet training implementation
- [model.py](mdc:HydroNet/models/DeepONet/model.py): Base DeepONet model

#### Physics-Informed DeepONet Models
Located in [HydroNet/models/PI_DeepONet/](mdc:HydroNet/models/PI_DeepONet):
