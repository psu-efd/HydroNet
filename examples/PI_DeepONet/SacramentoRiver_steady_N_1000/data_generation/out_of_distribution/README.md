## Generate Out-of-Distribution Data for PI-DeepONet

This directory contains the code for generating out-of-distribution data for PI-DeepONet. 

- There are several options for generating out-of-distribution data. In this example, the out-of-distribution data is generated by extending the inlet discharges beyond the range of the training data. Currenlty, the training data discharges are from uniform distributions. For out-of-distribution data with different distributions, the code can be modified accordingly.
- The normlization method and parameters should use those for the training data. They have to be consistent. 
- The script wil generate branch and trunk inputs for the DeepONet. The outputs are dummy data.
