## Sacramento River Steady Example

This example demonstrates how to use the PI_DeepONet model to train a model on the Sacramento River steady state example. It has three directories:
- `data_generation`: Contains the scripts to generate the data for the example.
- `SacramentoRiver_steady_DeepONet`: Contains the scripts to train the DeepONet model (without the physics-informed loss).
- `SacramentoRiver_steady_PI_DeepONet`: Contains the scripts to train the PI_DeepONet model (with the physics-informed loss).
