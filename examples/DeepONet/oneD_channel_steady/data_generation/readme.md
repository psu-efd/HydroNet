Simple 1D channel at steady state (one inlet upstream and one downstream boundary). 
- Upstream discharge is sampled in a range and simulated.
- Bathymetry is synthetic.
- Downstream using a rating curve.


How to run:
- run "preprocess_SRH_2D_simulations.py" to generate parameters etc
- run "run_SRH_2D_simulations.py" to run all the cases from the generated parameters
- run "postprocess_SRH_2D_simulations.py" to postprocess SRH-2D results
