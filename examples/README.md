This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the HydroNet framework.

## Available Examples

- `PI_DeepONet`: Contains examples demonstrating how to use the PI-DeepONet model.
- `PINN`: Contains examples demonstrating how to use the PINN model.


## Creating Your Own Examples

When creating your own examples, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the data for the example, depending on whether is is for PINN or PI-DeepONet.
2. Import the necessary modules from HydroNet
3. Create and configure the model using a configuration yaml file
4. Create a trainer for the model
5. Train the model
6. Use the trained model for predictions/applications
7. Plot the results of the example

See the existing examples for reference implementations.
